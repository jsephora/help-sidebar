<h1>BAS agent lodgment program 2015–16</h1>
<h2>About the BAS agent lodgment program 2015–16</h2>
<p>The <em>Lodgment program 2015–16</em> includes the following lodgment concessions for registered BAS agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>lodgment and payment concessions when you electronically lodge eligible quarterly activity statements</li>
<li>a lodgment concession for pay as you go (PAYG) withholding payment summary annual reports (not the closely held concession).</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that your clients receive the full lodgment program concessions, you should lodge activity statements (monthly December and quarterly activity statements) using one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>BAS Agent Portal</li>
<li>Standard Business Reporting (SBR)</li>
<li>Electronic Commerce Interface (ECI).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lodgment and payment due dates and concessional dates</h2>
<p>The lodgment program due dates for quarterly activity statements do not show on your client lists. The concessional due date for quarterly activity statements will be automatically updated online after you have lodged your clients’ activity statements electronically.</p>
