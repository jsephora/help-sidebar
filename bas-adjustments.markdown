<h1>Making adjustments on your activity statements</h1>
<p>On your current activity statement, you may have to make changes that increase or decrease how much GST you must pay for a reporting period. These changes are known as 'adjustments'.</p>
<p>There are two types of adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>increasing adjustments</strong>, which increase how much GST you must pay for a reporting period</li>
<li><strong>decreasing adjustments</strong>, which decrease how much GST you must pay for a reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<div class="attention"><img src="images/attention.png" alt="Attention" class="icon"><p>Correcting mistakes you made on an earlier activity statement is different from making an adjustment. For information on how to correct mistakes, refer to Correcting GST errors.</p>
