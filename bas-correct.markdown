<h1>How to make corrections on a later activity statement</h1>
<p>To correct a GST error, complete the appropriate boxes on the GST section of your activity statement.</p>
<p>If you are using the <strong>accounts method</strong>, you add or subtract the correction amount (the total overstated/understated GST amount, GST credit or GST adjustment) at boxes <strong>1A</strong> or <strong>1B</strong>. You also reflect the correction at boxes <strong>G1</strong>, <strong>G2</strong>, <strong>G3</strong>, <strong>G10</strong> or <strong>G11</strong> as appropriate.</p>
<p>If you are using the <strong>calculation sheet method</strong>, you add or subtract the GST inclusive amount of the correction at the appropriate box on the calculation worksheet. If the correction relates to a GST adjustment, multiply the adjustment by 11 and include the amount in <strong>G7</strong> (adjustments) if you have an increasing GST adjustment or <strong>G18</strong> (adjustments) if you have a decreasing GST adjustment.</p>
