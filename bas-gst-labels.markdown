<p>Most businesses can choose whether to include or exclude the GST component when reporting their taxable sales - select the <strong>'yes'</strong> or <strong>'no'</strong> at label <strong>G1</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have no sales for the reporting period, enter '0' at <strong>G1</strong>.</p>
<h2>G2 - Export sales</h2>
<p>Export sales to report at <strong>G2</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the free on-board value of exported goods that meet the GST-free export rules</li>
<li>payments for the repairs of goods from overseas that are to be exported</li>
<li>payments for goods used in the repair of goods from overseas that are to be exported.</li>
</ul>
<p>All amounts reported at <strong>G2</strong> should also have been reported at <strong>G1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Don't</strong> report at <strong>G2</strong> any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>amounts for GST-free services, unless they relate to the repair, renovation, modification or treatment of goods from overseas whose destination is outside Australia</li>
<li>amounts for freight and insurance for transport of the goods outside Australia, or other charges imposed outside Australia in the free on-board value</li>
<li>amounts for international transport of goods or international transport of passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these items are GST-free, they should be reported at <strong>G3</strong>.</p>
<h2>G3 - Other GST-free sales</h2>
<p>GST-free sales include things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>most basic foods</li>
<li>health and education services</li>
<li>certain childcare services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Report at <strong>G3</strong> all GST-free sales (other than export amounts shown at <strong>G2</strong>) that you've made. Amounts reported at <strong>G3</strong> should also have been reported at <strong>G1</strong>.</p>
<h2>G10 - Capital purchases</h2>
<p>Capital purchases include things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>land and buildings</li>
<li>machinery</li>
<li>cash registers</li>
<li>computers</li>
<li>cars.</li>
</ul>
<h2>G11 - Non-capital purchases</h2>
<p>Non-capital purchases include trading stock and normal running expenses, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>stationery and repairs</li>
<li>equipment rentals</li>
<li>leases.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your GST turnover is expected to be equal to or greater than $1 million, you need to separately report your capital and non-capital purchases at <strong>G10</strong> and <strong>G11</strong>.</p>
<p>If your GST turnover is expected to be less than $1 million, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to separately report your capital and non-capital purchases at <strong>G10</strong> and <strong>G11 </strong>using the current breakdown in your records, or</li>
<li>record capital items costing more than $1,000 at <strong>G10</strong> and non-capital items costing $1,000 or less at <strong>G11</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>G21-G24 - Option 3: pay GST instalment amount</h2>
<p>If you have chosen option 3 to report your GST (pay instalment amount quarterly and report annually), the pre-determined GST instalment amount is shown at <strong>G21</strong>. Simply copy this to <strong>1A</strong>.</p>
<p>If you think that the total of your advised instalment amounts will be more (or less) than your actual GST liability for the year, you can vary your instalment amount.</p>
<p>To vary your instalment amount you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>calculate your estimated annual GST liability and enter this at <strong>G22</strong></li>
<li>calculate your instalment amount for the quarter - this depends on the number of quarters remaining in the year and the amount of instalments you've already paid; enter this amount at <strong>G23</strong></li>
<li>indicate your reason for varying by entering the appropriate reason code at <strong>G24</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1A - GST on sales or GST instalment</h2>
<p>Report at <strong>1A</strong> the total amount of GST (including any relevant adjustments) you're liable to pay us for the reporting period.</p>
<p>If you have no GST on sales or adjustments for the reporting period, enter '0'.</p>
<p>If you report and pay GST quarterly using option 3 (the instalments option), report at <strong>1A</strong> your GST instalment amount displayed at <strong>G21</strong>. If you've varied this amount, take the figure from <strong>G23</strong> and report this amount at <strong>1A</strong>.</p>
<p>If you use option 3, you must also lodge an <em>Annual GST Return</em> at the end of the financial year and account for any difference between the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>your total GST instalments for the year</li>
<li>your actual GST liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In your <em>Annual GST Return</em>, report the total amount of GST on your sales plus any relevant adjustments at <strong>1A</strong>.</p>
<h2>1B - GST on purchases</h2>
<p>You report at <strong>1B</strong> the total amount of GST credits (including any relevant adjustments) you're eligible to claim from us.</p>
<p>If you have no GST on purchases or adjustments for the reporting period, enter '0'.</p>
<p>If you use option 3 (the instalments option), you won't need to complete <strong>1B</strong> on your quarterly BAS. However, you must complete this box on your <em>Annual GST Return</em> at the end of the financial year.</p>
<p>Your GST net amount is GST on sales (label <strong>1A</strong>) + WET (label <strong>1C</strong>) + LCT (label <strong>1E</strong>) minus GST on purchases (label <strong>1B</strong>) + WET refundable (label <strong>1D</strong>) + LCT refundable (label <strong>1F</strong>).</p>
<p>If you are a GST instalment payer, the total GST instalments paid by you (label <strong>1H</strong>) are taken into account when calculating your GST net amount.</p>
